## 🔍 Overview

The Decentralized Model Compute Network allows users to access distributed GPU computing power for various tasks. It features:

- Miners who offer computational power and validate work.
- Validators who ensure fairness and accuracy.
- Users who benefit from scalable, distributed compute power.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### ⛏️ Miners
Miners are the backbone of the network, performing the following roles:

- **Compute Serving:**
  - Provide computational power for user tasks.
  - Execute tasks on GPUs for real-time responses.

- **Proof of Work:**
  - Solve cryptographic challenges issued by validators.
  - Use CUDA-optimized hashing for efficient computation.

- **Submission and Reward:**
  - Submit PoW solutions for validation.
  - Earn rewards in tokens or cryptocurrency upon successful verification.

### 🛡️ Validators
Validators ensure network integrity by:

- **Challenge Distribution:**
  - Provide random string challenges to miners.
  - Ensure computational security and fairness.

- **Solution Verification:**
  - Validate submitted solutions against difficulty criteria.
  - Maintain miner performance and reliability metrics.

- **Reward Allocation:**
  - Reward miners for successful validations.
  - Penalize invalid submissions.

### 👥 Users
Users benefit from:

- **Inference Services:**
  - Submit queries for AI inference.
  - Receive fast and accurate results.

- **Payment System:**
  - Pay miners using network tokens or cryptocurrency.
  - Enjoy transparent and competitive pricing.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Computational Power
- Enables users to rent GPU power for intensive tasks.
- Supports multiple task types running in Docker containers for security.

### Proof of Work
- Uses CUDA-optimized hashing to minimize latency.
- Dynamically adjusts difficulty based on network load.

### Validation Layer
- Ensures correctness and fairness.
- Maintains a public ledger for miner rewards.

### Payment System
- Rewards miners based on task completion.
- Penalizes downtime or invalid submissions.

## 🔐 Proof of Work Details

1. **Challenge Issuance:** Validators issue random challenges.
2. **Nonce Calculation:** Miners calculate a nonce to meet hash criteria (e.g., first three characters are `000`).
3. **Difficulty Adjustment:** Hashing difficulty adjusts dynamically based on network activity.
4. **Verification:** Validators verify and reward valid solutions.

## 🚀 Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Development
- Develop miner and validator modules.
- Integrate GPU-optimized PoW.

### Phase 2: Use Case Expansion
- Introduce decentralized governance.
- Implement Docker layers for GPU tasks.

### Phase 3: Rental Features
- Allow users to rent GPU power for specific durations.
- Enhance fraud detection mechanisms.

### Phase 4: Full Decentralization
- Aggregate rental and CPU-based tasks.
- Suggest miners based on user needs and performance.
